## Experiment Setup

- Positive label definition: KuaiRec watch ratio threshold, MovieLens rating threshold, or MIND clicked impression labels depending on adapter.
- Split strategy: per-user temporal split; MIND additionally keeps all rows from one impression in the same split.
- filter_seen strategy: `train,val`
- candidate_pool_k: `500`
- cutoffs: `[5, 10, 20, 50, 100]`
- retriever list: `popular, itemcf, bpr, lightgcn, two_tower, sasrec, content_faiss, metadata`
- ranker list: `none`

## Retriever Comparison

| retrievers | Recall@10 |
| --- | --- |
| metadata | 0.001401 |

## Ranker Comparison

| ranker | Recall@10 |
| --- | --- |
| none | 0.001401 |

## Rerank Fusion Comparison

| rerank_mode | Recall@10 |
| --- | --- |
| retrieval_only | 0.001401 |

## Feature Ablation

The matrix keeps `retrieval_only`, `ranker_only`, and `retrieval_ranker_fusion` rows. Retrieval-side features include retrieval score, retrieval source, source rank, source count, item popularity, user activity level, and history length.

| ranker | rerank_mode | Recall@10 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none | retrieval_only | 0.001401 |

## Retrieval Source Contribution

Single-source rows estimate marginal source quality. The `fusion` row uses RRF over configured retrievers.

| retrievers | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| metadata | 0.203795 |

## Business Rerank Before / After

| business_reranker | NDCG@10_before_business_rerank | NDCG@10_after_business_rerank | Coverage_before_business_rerank | Coverage_after_business_rerank | Diversity_before_business_rerank | Diversity_after_business_rerank | TailRatio_before_business_rerank | TailRatio_after_business_rerank |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | 0.001349 | None | 0.203795 | None | 0.010537 | None | 0.000770 | None |

## Cold-Start Analysis

Cold-start is approximated through user/item coverage and failure cases in `failure_cases.json`. A production version should add explicit buckets for new users, short-history users, new items, and tail items.

## Tail Item Analysis

| retrievers | business_reranker | TailRatio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| metadata | none | 0.000770 |

## LLM Role and Safety

LLM is not allowed to generate recommendation item IDs. The measurable safety smoke test checks hallucinated item ID rejection.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| hallucinated_item_id_rate | 0.333333 |
| template_fallback_rate | 0.333333 |
| unsupported_claim_rate | 0.333333 |

## Failure Cases

See `failure_cases.json` for users with no hit in the evaluated recommendation list.

## Known Limitations

- Offline metrics do not prove online CTR or retention lift.
- Compact neural retrievers/rankers are for interview-grade experiments, not distributed production training.
- Full KuaiRec requires local raw data; sample data is provided only for command smoke tests.
